## Description

_{This is a detailed description of your application. Its purpose and usage.  Give as much detail as needed to explain what the application does, and any other information you want users or other developers to have. }_

## Specs

1. [_**Input: "a" and "a"- Expected Output: "1 Match"**_] User inputs the simplest string possible, in this case "a", and the program outputs that it matches once in the given string.

2. [_**Input: "a" and "a a" - Expected Output: "2 Matches"**_] User inputs the simplest string possible "a" and a string containing two a's, "a a". The program then outputs it has two matches.

3. [_**Input "dog" and "the dog likes to run in the dog park" - Expected Output: "2 Matches"**_] User inputs a string "dog" and a string containing multiple words containing multiple instances of the word "dog." The program then cycles through the string and finds two instances of the word "dog" and outputs that it has two matches.

4. [_**Input "cat" and "The cat likes to run with the other cats on the cathedral" - Expected Output: "1 Match"**_] User inputs a string "cat" and a string containing multiple words containing only one instance of the word "cat" but with other words CONTAINING the string "cat". Due to the way the program runs, only matching complete full word matches, the program should not match "cat" with either "cats" or "cathedral" and should only output that there is one match.
